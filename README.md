<h1 align="center">     My Pholio     </h1>



**Data Scientist & Data Engineer** with a background in **Electrical Engineering** and hands-on experience across the **energy, retail, and technology** sectors. I design and implement **end-to-end data solutions** — from automated ingestion and transformation pipelines to predictive models and dashboards that enable data-driven decision-making at scale.

**Strong expertise in:**
- **Data Engineering & Orchestration:** Databricks (Delta Live Tables, Jobs, Workflows, SQL Warehouses), PySpark, Fivetran, AWS (S3, Glue, Lambda), ETL/ELT automation, and scalable data architectures (Medallion).
- **Machine Learning & Analytics:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, feature engineering, time series forecasting, and MLflow for model tracking and deployment.
- **Data Visualization & BI:** Power BI, Databricks SQL Dashboards, Tableau, and Streamlit for interactive analytics and reporting.
- **Cloud & MLOps:** AWS, Databricks Repos, CI/CD pipelines, REST APIs, and model deployment workflows.

I specialize in building **reliable, production-ready pipelines** and **machine learning models** that integrate seamlessly with cloud infrastructure — ensuring performance, traceability, and scalability.

With a blend of **technical depth and business insight**, I thrive at the intersection of **engineering, data, and strategy**, delivering solutions that not only work — they move the needle.

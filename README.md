<h1 align="center">âš¡     My Pholio     ðŸ“Š</h1>



Data Scientist & Data Engineer with a background in Electrical Engineering and experience across the energy, retail, and technology sectors. I specialize in building end-to-end data solutions â€” from large-scale pipelines and predictive models to interactive dashboards that drive strategic decision-making.

ðŸ”¹ Strong expertise in:
- **Data Engineering & Pipelines**: ETL, PySpark, SQL, AWS (S3, Lambda, Glue, SageMaker), Databricks  
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, time series, predictive modeling  
- **Visualization & Apps**: Power BI, Streamlit, Tableau  
- **Cloud & MLOps**: AWS, CI/CD, APIs, model deployment  

My goal is to transform complex datasets into actionable insights and scalable solutions that generate measurable impact. With a mix of technical depth and business vision, I thrive at the intersection of **engineering, data, and strategy**.

Outside of pure data, I bring experience in consultative sales, project leadership, and technical bids â€” a combination that allows me to not only build solutions but also align them with business growth.

Data Scientist and Electrical Engineer with experience in the energy sector, predictive analytics, and cloud-based solutions. I combine engineering and data science to solve complex business and operational challenges.

- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
- SQL and relational databases

Experienced in building large-scale data pipelines with a strategic, results-driven approach. I turn raw data into high-impact decisions.
